= Ruby Holidays Gem
  
A set of classes to deal with holidays in Ruby.

Extends Ruby's built-in Date class and supports custom holiday definition lists.

=== Examples

==== Using the Holidays class
  # Get all holidays on April 25, 2008 in Australia
  date = Date.civil(2008,4,25)
  Holidays.by_day(date, :au)
  => [{:name => 'ANZAC Day',...}]


  # Get all holidays in July, 2008 in Canada and the US
  from = Date.civil(2008,7,1)
  to   = Date.civil(2008,7,31)
  Holidays.between(from, to, :ca,:us)
  => [{:name => 'Canada Day',...}
      {:name => 'Independence Day',...}]


==== Extending Ruby's Date class
  # Lookup Canada Day in the :ca region
  Date.civil(2008,7,1).holiday?(:ca)
  => true
  
  # Lookup Canada Day in the :fr region
  Date.civil(2008,7,1).holiday?(:fr)
  => false
